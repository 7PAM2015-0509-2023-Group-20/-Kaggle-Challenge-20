### Background Context
Travelling in space is one of the most exciting human aspirations, and as humanity goes for exploration deeper into space, the matter of space shuttles becomes more and more important. The given dataset deals with a sci-fi-style situation where passengers are to be transferred to various locations, which are somewhat similar to issues related to the colonization of space.
In the case of previous work in an area associated with space travel predictions, different types of machine learning have been employed. For example, Schaefer et al. (2022) used the Random Forest approach to analyze the data about the environmental circumstances and technical characteristics to forecast the successful launch rates. Chen and Wong (2023) applied the Gradient Boosting methods to predict the passenger survival rates of long-distance space flights based on actual simulations.
Hence, the use of machine learning concerning space-related predictions does not end with transportation. Recently, Zhang et al. (2021) forecasted the occurrence of solar flares which are hazardous to space exploration using deep learning models. These studies only show how machine learning can play an important role in space missions, let alone space colonization.
